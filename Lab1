  <h3>Hello world!</h3>

  <p>My name is Rosana Sincere and I'm from Miami, Florida.</p> 
  <p>I'm 18 and I'm currently attending Illinois Intitute of Technology. </p>
  My major is Infromation Technology and Management.</p>
  <p>I have a history with software design and cyber security, so I'm not sure which field I'd like to specialize in yet since I find them both very interesting.</p>
  <p> I'm also passionate about music. I play both the guitar and the ukulele (although I'm not very good with either).
